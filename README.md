# Tandem
DH Project to analyze text and images in one interface

PYTHON SETUP
Mac's come with Python. I would suggest you work with that version unless issues arise.

NLTK SET UP
For help outside of these notes go to http://nltk.org

Launch Terminal.
These steps are all commands you type at the command line prompt except for
the first which a hyperlink. You type the text after the word run in each line.
Install Setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
Install Pip: run sudo easy_install pip
Install Numpy: run sudo pip install -U numpy
Install NLTK: run sudo pip install -U nltk


Test to see if your installation worked:
run python then type import nltk
Success will be if no errors are displayed after the import command.
